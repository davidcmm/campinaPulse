Art must be the size of a small person or have clear identification indicating its status as art (creator, dedication, year, materials, etc.)|If the art can be isolated as a specific artistic element of a facade, the building counts as one instance of public art|If the art is in someone's property, but it is visible to the passing pedestrian and it has free access, it can be considered public art|Small fountains and graffiti murals would be included, but simple chalk drawings and graffiti tags would not be included"
